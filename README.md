# HAM-I

A Human-Alien-Messaging Interface, where an alien sends you a message! Very minimal, took me an hour - made for Toppings by Hack Club.

# Demo

- You can [demo here!](https://ham-i.vercel.app/)

# The Site:

- An alien is trying to send you a transmission message.
- You can choose to accept, deny, or check details.
- It's a nice message, I promise!

# Requirements:

- Veryyy unique? I hope!
- The border of the container is animated.
- Uses both vw values and media queries.
- Containers have been used!
- Both a grid (for the buttons) AND a gradient background!
